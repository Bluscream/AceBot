performance:
 - could more stuff be cached? check how many db calls per message/command

voice activity logs, doesn't log when someone leaves a channel

mutes are fucked, need to remove member role

set up system for emailing exception stacktraces

on action for kick patterns it could also show the id

new stuff for roles selector:
- add toggle for inline
- add edits (roles edit <role> <field> * <new_value>)

autohotkey specific:
- new users get PMd or pinged when they havent accepted for 24 hrs
